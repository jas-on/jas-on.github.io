summary: Taking a respite with CS on my mind
---
Terse instructions,  
albeit expressive.  
Beautiful.  
Elegant.

Clockwork inside;  
no unnecessary cogs.  
Organized.  
Deterministic.

To the expecting,  
cleverness;  
to others,  
confusion.

Sentences as bricks;  
paragraphs as houses.  
Imagine an essay!
