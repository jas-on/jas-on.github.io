title: Cookbook for The Zone at UCSD
summary: jQuery is a hammer
---
I think jQuery has built a really great ecosystem - there are so many plugins that even the most niche problems are covered. The downside is that there's a strong culture against the Not-Invented-Here itch, and a lot of time can be spent on finding the 'best' plugin for the job.

Using jQuery was a success story in this instance, though. I wanted to post recipes online for dishes that were made at cooking demos held at [The Zone](thezone.ucsd.edu). After about fifteen minutes of researching, I found the [booklet](http://builtbywill.com/code/booklet/) plugin and created The Zone's online [cookbook](https://wellness.ucsd.edu/zone/publications/Pages/cookbook.aspx). Unfortunately, it's only semi-responsive.
