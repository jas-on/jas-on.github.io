title: Recovering a file with Git

## Get your code into Git ASAP
r/TIFU lost a post because of Git.

It was a nice day out and we had just finished writing some tedious Selenium tests. I was pair programming with my coworker for about an hour and we were getting ready to switch seats when the incident happened. She `rm`ed a wrong file and freaked out.

At first I chuckled,

> "Eh, at least we know what we tested and I really enjoy typing!"

but then I remembered that Git is awesome.

> "There's gotta be some way to recover this file without having to do some low-level sysadmin magic".

And, on that day, I learned that there is indeed a way.

## `git fsck`
We ran `git fsck --unreachable --lost-found` and found our 2 man hours worth of work in `.git/lost-found/other/`. See, no reason to fret! Basically, as long as Git knows about your file, you can almost always recover it (this would have been a different story if it wasn't). You can check out all of the options available for `git fsck` [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck). I also highly recommend learning about [`git reflog`](http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/09/reflog-your-safety-net.html) which shows you everything that Git is doing in your repo.
