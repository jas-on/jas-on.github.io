This last week went alright. For most of the week I tested my project a lot and made sure the main features were performing expectedly. I had also participated in a code review with some of the other developers on the team. I gained a lot of insight into some better practices in C# but for the most part there weren’t any scathing remarks and I received some praise on my architecture design. I was given a lot of freedom in choosing how to implement my project and it was my first time creating something by myself at work (rather than receiving tasks to work on a discrete chunk of a project).

I am very happy with my internship experience. I learned a lot of new technologies such as WCF services and AngularJS and have gained a better understanding of Microsoft’s technology stack as well as Single Page Applications as a web application architecture. In general, I’m a lot less shy to try out new frameworks or third party libraries and I think that will help my development speed when working on larger projects in the future. I really enjoy learning new things and have felt like I can take on almost any project, lately. I gained a lot of confidence in software design and architecturing a system from scratch; I used to be scared of it but now it’s really fun for me. I think my passion for programming has grown throughout this summer and I can’t wait to apply it in my classes during the next school year.
