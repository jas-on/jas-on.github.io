title: Burnout Protection
summary: I don’t think I’m burning out, but a lot of my peers believe I’m nearing it.

I have seen countless articles about burnout being posted on Hacker News recently. I don’t know if they are making the rounds more often or if I’m more aware of them because I’m falling victim to it. I don’t think I’m burning out, but a lot of my peers believe I’m nearing it. I know the symptoms of it although I believe it’s a much more personalized experience that can’t be diagnosed with a bullet point checklist.

Burnout typically arises from a desire to work harder and harder, with the reward of working even more. Over and over again people say to do something about it by _spending more time on yourself_ and knowing that it’s okay to _slow down your pace_. I exercise, I socialize, and I care for myself. I know that it’s okay to take a break every so often. But, for some strange reason, I don’t know if I’m doing enough.

The protocol I’ve recently decided to enact is called **burnout protection**. I have been forcing myself to take more discrete breaks, and acknowledging that I shouldn’t be doing or thinking about work (course, job, etc.) at all. I’ve been inclined to adopt this strategy because I think it also serves as great task prioritization/ time organization practice. Even though I might not have shown it previously, I truly believe the cliche key to a productive life is being able to balance work and play. When I was younger, I had a bunch of fun with playing video games and accepting almost every social event invitation thrown at me. When I entered college, I was too scared to even try my hand at fun because I was afraid I would lose control and lose sight of my goal of learning as much as I could and landing a good job after graduation.

I was a coward, and it was hurting me in a much different way. I was missing the point of life. I was missing experiencing great things which were equally important to learning and programming. As human beings, we’re not robots who act deterministically on some fuel. Where is the line between being a slacker and being a burnout candidate, known to some as **tryhard**, though? It’s a tough call, but I’d rather err on the side of the former.

How does this relate to software development at all? Thinking critically, albeit at all, takes a lot of energy. Being able to produce quality code and handle the frustration of persistent bug hunting falls into this category. It’s irrational to think that one can work forever with the same quality of effort, and that’s why breaks are necessary. You will probably find that you’re even more productive by working less hours with solid breaks in between than by working non-stop without any respite. Many people incorrectly think that it’s all about the cold, hard hours-of-work count in measuring productivity, but they’re missing the fact that if their rate-of-work is low, they’ll miscalculate every time.
