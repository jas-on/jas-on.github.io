title: Looking back on my college years
summary: Tradeoffs, sure. Regrets, maybe.
---
A high school acquaintance recently asked me:

> When you started your junior year of college, did you know it was going to be your last year? If you had the chance to relive your time as an undergrad, would you have done anything differently?

It took a lot of introspection to answer that question.

Throughout college, I wanted to study hard, gain as much work experience as possible, max out my free time with productive activities, and maintain my physical health. I wanted to graduate early with an impactful job. I decided on these goals during senior year when my graduating class went on a beach trip. I was still a little heartbroken at the time that I didn't get into Berkeley with my friends, that I wasn't impressively smart. I knew that I was hardworking and disciplined, though, so that's why I made the goals I did - to test the maximum potential of my strengths.

I went into college knowing that I would be making tradeoffs to achieve my goals. I knew (or at least thought I knew) that I wouldn't be able to join clubs, that I wouldn't be able to date someone, that I wouldn't spend too much time with friends, that the days would be long. I took sick pride in creating my schedules each quarter, filling in as many classes as I could, and marking the gaps between them with work so that 8am to 8pm would be filled up.

You know how people say the grass is greener on the other side? Maybe experiencing the college life in its totality would have been great. My discipline to reach the goal was so strong that I managed to bottle my emotions for 3 years to get through it. I don't think I can regret what I've achieved but, now that I'm out of college, I'm starting to realize more clearly what I missed out on, especially forgoing any relationship. Maybe I was too hard on myself, and it was never a tradeoff that I had to make. It's hard to tell.
