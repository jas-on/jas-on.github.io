title: Black-box compiler
summary: Reducing students' stress with an example implementation
---
Back when I took CSE 131, UCSD's compilers course, there was more stress amongst students. I think it's because implementing semantic analysis is generally rote work and there are a plethora of edge cases to cover. There was a greater sense of camaraderie too. Students shared hundreds of tests with each other while suffering together. Now, there's a black-box implementation of the language spec that students can play around with and try to emulate. I'm happy about the decision to provide an example compiler because (maybe I'm being idealistic) students can focus more on the theory.

I wonder if I influenced the decision by hosting [my own compiler](https://github.com/jas-on/CSE131OutputGenerator/blob/master/index.php) while I was taking the class.
