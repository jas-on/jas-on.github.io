title: Left Center Right and Friends
summary: Winning isn't everything
---
My high school friends and I hung out yesterday and we played a mindless game as the night wound down. It's called "[Left Center Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCR_(dice_game))", and the goal of the game is to win all of the chips from a fixed pot by getting lucky with dice rolls. On the drive home, I realized how simple it is to simulate the game. I wrote up a C++ program which models the game with a state machine and plays it. You can input the number of players and chips you want the game to have through the crude CLI.

Maybe I'm being a bit cynical, but I made the program output how many man hours are 'saved' by simulating the game rather than playing it for real. Sometimes mindless games are fun because they allow people to focus on each other's company rather than beating each other.
