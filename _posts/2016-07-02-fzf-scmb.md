`fzf` provides some nice features out of the box, one of them is fuzzy completion for hostnames.

When I tried it out

```
ssh .<TAB>
```

I got

```
0/0
>
```

and then after CTRL-c

```
‚ùØ ssh ./bin/cat: /proc/self/fd/12: No such file or directory
/bin/cat: /proc/self/fd/13: No such file or directory
/bin/cat: /proc/self/fd/14: No such file or directory
```

I found out that setting [`shell_command_wrapping_enabled`](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze/blob/b6531e8379122675168c053c7b7111746b4891c6/lib/git/shell_shortcuts.sh#L20) to `false` in `.git.scmbrc` (`scm_breeze`'s config) makes `fzf` ssh hostname completion work as intended. Of course, the downside is that you can't use `scm_breeze`'s numbering when invoking common shell commands because they won't be expanded.

`smc_breeze` does feel a bit intrusive, though. Another example is how it tries to [play nicely with RVM](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze/blob/b6531e8379122675168c053c7b7111746b4891c6/lib/git/shell_shortcuts.sh#L29).

I didn't bother spending any more time sleuthing into the exact source of the error messages (on `fzf` or `scm_breeze`'s side).
