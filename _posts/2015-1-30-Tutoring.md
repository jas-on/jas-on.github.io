summary: My reflections on how to be a good tutor.
---

Ever since I started my college education I knew that I wanted to share some knowledge that I gained with other people. I knew that I wanted to become a tutor eventually. I find helping others appealing and solidifying my own knowledge in the subject matter is pretty nice too.

This January, I took up tutoring for the compiler construction course offered at UCSD which involves two main projects concerning semantic analysis and code generation (a reduced set of C to SPARC assembly to be specific). This course has a reputation for being a time consuming and burdensome class amongst the CS students and many dread taking it.

I didn't.

I expected there to be a large time investment and enjoyed each bite of the workload. I know that most students who take the course would not think this way and would consider me a no-lifer. I accept that to a certain degree and would also like to add that I like to work hard, often.

But there's an issue here.

There are students who take this course while upholding many other obligations and don't have the time to enjoy the intricacies of building a compiler. They build it with the objective of getting a good score and not learning good software design or compiler theory. This is a problem.

That's why I feel obligated as a tutor to help students with achieving their first objective and remind them not to overlook the second one. Actually, I don't just remind them; I force it on them. I ask them what they're currently implementing and how they're doing it. If their way isn't great, I hint them at a better design or paint a vivid picture of how hard other parts of the project will be if they design the current part poorly. If a student is stuck on how to approach a feature, I
ask them to think like a compiler and walk them through the theory.

I am a novice tutor, and I think I'm on track to be a great one.
